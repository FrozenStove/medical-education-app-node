Title: Radiation Therapy in Breast Cancer Management

Introduction:
Radiation therapy plays a crucial role in the multidisciplinary approach to breast cancer treatment. This article focuses on the specific aspects of radiation therapy relevant to radiation oncologists.

Key Topics:
1. Indications for Radiation
   - Post-lumpectomy treatment
   - Post-mastectomy indications
   - Locally advanced disease

2. Treatment Planning
   - Target volume definition
   - Heart sparing techniques
   - Lung dose considerations
   - Treatment field setup

3. Modern Techniques
   - Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)
   - Deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH)
   - Prone positioning
   - Partial breast irradiation

4. Dose and Fractionation
   - Standard whole breast irradiation
   - Hypofractionated regimens
   - Accelerated partial breast irradiation
   - Dose constraints for organs-at-risk

5. Side Effects and Management
   - Acute skin reactions
   - Late cardiac effects
   - Pulmonary toxicity
   - Fibrosis and other long-term effects

6. Special Considerations
   - Left-sided breast cancer
   - Large-breasted patients
   - Post-surgical reconstruction
   - Lymphedema prevention

7. Clinical Trials and Research
   - Ongoing studies in breast radiation
   - Emerging technologies
   - Future directions in treatment

8. Follow-up and Survivorship
   - Long-term monitoring
   - Quality of life considerations
   - Survivorship care planning

This document provides a comprehensive guide for radiation oncologists in the management of breast cancer patients using radiation therapy.
